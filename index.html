<h1>Experiment</h1>

<p>These are simple pages that I use as a test bed.  They generally don't do very much, but help me to understand what some code is supposed to be do.

<h2><a href="viewport.html">viewport</a></h2>

<p>I have been using BootStrap's breakpoints in my CSS for responsive design.  I recently became aware that my phone is considerably smaller than BootStrap's small screen size (572 pixels) and much much smaller than the manufacturer specs say it is.  So how big is it?</p>

<p>viewport uses properties of document.body to display the width and heigth of the viewport.</p>
