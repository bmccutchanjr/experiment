<h1>Experiment</h1>

<p>These are simple pages that I use as a test bed.  They generally don't do very much, but I need to access them from various devices for one reason or another, so putting them on the web is kinda necessary (and GitHub seemed like a good place to do it).</p>

<p>There are also some pages here that work just fine from the local file system, but after a recent scare I decided I need/want to back them up.  Again, GitHub seems like a good place to do it.</p>

<h2><a href="viewport.html">viewport</a></h2>

<p>I have been using BootStrap's breakpoints in my CSS for responsive design.  I recently became aware that my phone is considerably smaller than BootStrap's small screen size (572 pixels) and much smaller than the manufacturer specs say it is.  So how big is it?</p>

<p>viewport uses properties of document.body to display the width and heigth of the viewport.</p>
